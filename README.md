# Asian Stamp Appraiser GPT

**Custom GPT for visual-based stamp valuation — focused on Asian philately (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India).**

This GPT is a virtual philatelist that evaluates individual stamps and collections using uploaded images and online catalogs. It recognizes visual details like:

It provides:
- **Accurate value estimates** based on condition + catalog references
- **Catalog lookups** from Scott, Michel, Chan, and others
- **Real-world pricing** from sources like eBay, Rakuten, and regional stamp websites
- **Forgery detection tips** and **grading visual guide**
